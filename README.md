Prerequisites
Before you can run this project locally, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (which includes npm, the Node package manager). You can download it from the official website.

How to Run Locally
Follow these steps to get the chatbot running on your own computer.

1. Clone the Repository
First, get a copy of the project files. If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository:

git clone <your-github-repository-url>
cd <your-project-directory>

Alternatively, you can download the project files as a ZIP and extract them.

2. Install Dependencies
The project relies on several Node.js packages. Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command to install them.

npm install

3. Set Up Your Environment Variables
The application needs your unique Google Gemini API key to work.

In the project's root directory, create a new file named .env.

Copy the content below into your new .env file.

Replace your_gemini_api_key_here with your actual API key.

# .env file content
PORT=3000
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

How to get a Gemini API Key:

Visit Google AI Studio.

Sign in and create a new API key.

Copy the key and paste it into your .env file.

4. Start the Server
Once the dependencies are installed and your API key is set, you can start the server with this command:

npm start

You should see a message in your terminal indicating that the server is running:
ðŸŽ“ K-12 Teaching Chatbot running on http://localhost:3000

5. Open in Your Browser
Open your web browser and navigate to the following address:
http://localhost:3000

You should now be able to interact with your chatbot!

How to Deploy to Render
This project is configured for easy deployment on Render, a cloud platform for hosting web applications.

1. Push to GitHub
Make sure your latest code is pushed to a GitHub repository. Your .gitignore file should prevent the node_modules and .env files from being uploaded.

2. Create a Render Account
Sign up for a free account on Render and connect it to your GitHub account.

3. Create a New Web Service
On the Render dashboard, click New + > Web Service.

Select your GitHub repository for the project and click Connect.

Configure the service with the following settings:

Name: A unique name for your app (e.g., teaching-chatbot).

Runtime: Node (should be auto-detected).

Build Command: npm install

Start Command: node index.js

4. Add Environment Variable
This is the most important step. Your live application needs the API key to function.

Scroll down to the Environment section.

Click Add Environment Variable.

Enter the following:

Key: GEMINI_API_KEY

Value: Paste your actual Gemini API key here.

5. Deploy
Select the Free instance type and click Create Web Service. Render will automatically build and deploy your application. Once it's live, you will be given a public URL to access your chatbot.
